My [conspect](https://github.com/rcd27/learning-rxjava-ru/blob/master/conspect.md) 
of great [book](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-rxjava)
by [Thomas Nield](https://github.com/thomasnield).
It is made in my native Russian language so this can be usefull for any russian-speaking programmer since there is no
official translation for it.
